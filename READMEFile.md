## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Problem
The bike-sharing dataset requires cleaning and preprocessing to address data inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. The large dataset size poses challenges in terms of efficient processing. The team will utilize Python libraries to analyze and visualize the data, transforming it into a structured format for meaningful insights.

### 1.2 Objective
This project aims to preprocess and analyze a public bike-sharing dataset using Python libraries. The objective is to extract valuable insights through data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, to support decision-making in the bike-sharing service.
## 2. Dataset Overview and Source
The **Ford Go Bike Data** dataset is obtained from a public bike-sharing service. It includes variables such as gender, start time, end time, start station, end station, user type, and more. The dataset represents a sample of bike rides taken over a certain period of time.
The dataset is available on the official website of the bike-sharing service or through data repositories such as Kaggle or the company's data portal.

## 3. Final Ten Insights
